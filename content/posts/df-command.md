summary: Today we worked through a deployment issue where the deployments failed due to the server running out of disk space. This is how we used the df command to resolve the issue.

Earlier today we had an issue deploying a front-end application. The deployment process is a bit peculiar since we use Netlify to build the application and then copy the source file to a legacy server. I found out later that this was a half-done migration. Eventually, the site will be wholly served by Netlify.

Our developer deployed the app, Netlify said the build succeeded, and our chatbot returned a successful build. But, unfortunately, the code was not in the client.

To debug this, I first downloaded the master branch and ensured that the code was merged correctly. Then I verified that the build on Netlify contained the latest code. Lastly, I figured the failure must have been on the custom server.

When I logged in to the server, every time I tried to cd to a directory I saw this error:

```
bash: cannot create temp file for here-document: No space left on device
```
So, I consulted Dr. Google and [found a great article that explained](https://www.ostechnix.com/the-df-command-tutorial-with-examples-for-beginners/) `df`.

After running df, I found out that 99% of the disk was being used and the deploy couldn't be written to the disk.

I chatted with our platform team and they cleared out the Nginx logs and we were able to deploy again.
